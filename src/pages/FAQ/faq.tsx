                    My manuscript is in multiple files. Does Stratton Press merge them into one file for me?
                    </summary>
                    <p> Stratton Press requires authors to merge their own files prior to submitting them 
                      to the Project Management Officer. This is to ensure the sequence of the manuscript 
                      is accurate. <br/><br/>
                      Microsoft Word makes it very easy to merge multiple documents into one 
                      file. Just follow these steps: <br/> 
                      1. Open the first word document of your manuscript. <br/> 
                      2. Place the text cursor at the end of the document, or that space where you would like the next file to start. <br/> 
                      3. At the top of your opened Microsoft Word document is a toolbar. Find the “Insert” menu and select “File”. <br/> 
                      4. Browse for and select the next file to be merged. <br/>  
                      5. Repeat as necessary.
