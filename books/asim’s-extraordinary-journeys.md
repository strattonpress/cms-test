It was a magical time of wicked kings and monsters. This second book takes Asim and his brave warriors on an epic journey, as they cross the lands to help those less fortunate, those not able to help themselves. This time, they are on a journey to Ghant to help two tribes; plagued by robbers; who kill not only elephants to steal their ivory tusks; but the tribesmen guarding them too.



The author takes you on an extraordinary journey, where you will encounter strange people, places, wizards, witches, and dragons along the way. Go with Asim and his friends on this fun packed but perilous journey through the mountains, forests, and villages as they put their lives on the line to try and end this ever-growing plight.
